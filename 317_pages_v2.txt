Middle Beach and the Durdle Door are on the West side and Mupe Bay and Arish Mel are Eastwards. Enjoy a pint in the dog friendly Castle Inn on Lulworth Cove.</p><p>If you are looking for a traditional English seaside getaway, then why not try Swanage.

You can see the stone walls that would have formed the magnificent house and the original mosaic floor, all dating back to the 4<sup>th</sup> century AD. When you have had your fill of shopping and culture, relax in one of Dorchester’s lovely restaurants, from pavement cafes to Michelin starred establishments. Just take your pick!</p><p>For a more peaceful retreat, we have Dream cottages in Osmington. This is a walker’s paradise with the Jurassic Coastline literally on your doorstep. Walk along the coast admiring the magnificent views of the dramatic coastline on one side and the beautiful unspoilt Dorset countryside on the other. Look for the ‘Osmington White Horse’ etched into the land with chalk. The figure is of King George III riding his horse back to London and celebrates King George’s famous visits to Weymouth. Spend the day in Osmington Mills fossil hunting and then pop into the Smugglers Inn pub for some local ale by a roaring fire. Osmington is also perfectly located to enjoy the beauty of Lulworth Cove and the golden sands of Weymouth Bay.</p><p>For the most delightful of towns, Wareham definitely fits the bill. Try the charming, old fashioned cinema, The Rex. They show family matinees in the school holidays so you can sit with the children and even enjoy a glass of wine during the film from its lovely bar. Wareham is a relaxed and peaceful market town, made pretty by the streets of Georgian cottages along the pretty River Frome. For a special afternoon why not hire a rowing boat and row along the Frome enjoying the peace and tranquillity of this very charming river. Have a look at Clouds Hill Cottage, the rural retreat of T.E Lawrence. Visit Monkey World, and say hello to the rescued apes. Pop just outside of Wareham to the Tank Museum or take a ride on the Paddle Steamer Monarch. Travel in style on one of the only three working paddle steamers in the UK.

It offers arguably the best sailing and windsurfing waters in the world, an abundance of rare wildlife since Portland is a major migrating point for birds, miles of stunning coastal walks, great fishing trips straight from Portland Marina, beautiful beaches, some of which are dog friendly all year around, fantastic pubs and some of the best cream teas in Dorset.</p><p>Our Portland holiday cottages are equally perfect for those wishing to enjoy the great outdoors, as well as those wishing to cosy up with stunning views right outside their cottage windows.</p><p>Meander through the pretty villages filled with old stone cottages, cobbled streets, traditional shops and cafes and stop for cream tea and lashings of luscious cake.

The visitor centre has had a huge amount of money spent on it in recent years to make it all the more exciting for children (and adults). Let them experience a stormy sea journey in the ‘Into the Dark’ interactive zone and then all climb the lighthouse tower and take in the views for miles and miles, along the stunning Jurassic coastline. From here you get the best view of the Portland Race too, which is the treacherous part of the sea for vessels and the reason why the Portland Bill Lighthouse is still a working lighthouse today.</p><p><strong>Portland Castle</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/portland-castle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Portland Castle</a>, overlooking Portland Harbour was constructed under Henry VIII in the early 1540’s to defend the south coast against the ever-present threat of French and Spanish invasion.</p><p>Walk along the gun platforms and look out to the beautiful Dorset seas.

We are lucky enough to call this perfect English seaside town, home, and as such we are in the perfect position to tell you all about it!</p><p>Weymouth is the perfect place to recapture the nostalgia of childhood family holidays. The beach is golden and sandy and bustling with activity. The fine sand is great for sand castle building and the shallow paddling waters are perfect for families. The traditional Punch and Judy puppet shows, donkey rides, carousels, fish and chip shops, penny slot machines and the best sunshine record in England mean that Weymouth beach is pretty much the best family holiday location on the planet! (We could be biased)</p><p>The town itself is beautiful. The beach is positioned against a backdrop of impressive Georgian buildings, dating back some 200 years, when Kind George III famously spent his holidays here. The Royal Hotel, once the Assembly Rooms, was a favourite spot for King George for dancing and socialising. If you look at the Georgian townhouses and villas along the sea front, you will notice that many of them do not have letterboxes, since the penny stamp was not invented until 1840.</p><p>One of the most wonderful things about Weymouth is the harbour. Reputed to be one of the prettiest in Europe, it is alive and bustling with crabbers and fishermen and the best place to take a walk with a bag of freshly caught Billy Winters (Weymouth Bay prawns), soaking up traditional harbour life. There are some wonderful pubs and restaurants dotted along the harbour, where fish is served directly from the sea in front.</p><h3>About Portland</h3><p>Portland is a part of Dorset that is unlike the rest of the county. While the rest of Dorset is all rolling green hills, golden beaches and idyllic English villages, Portland is beautiful but in a completely different way. Portland, which is a majestic lump of rock rising above the sea, is wild, rugged and dramatic. It is faintly connected to the rest of Dorset by the sweep of Chesil Beach.</p><p>The famous red and white Portland Bill Lighthouse is at the southernmost tip of Portland and is a feature on many a Dorset postcard. Paying a visit to the lighthouse should definitely feature on your Portland itinerary. Climb to the top and see for miles across the beautiful Dorset coastline. Gaze down to the most treacherous patch of sea in the area ‘The Portland Race’, which has resulted in the demise of many a ship over the years.</p><p>The villages within Portland are completely charming, filled with old stone cottages, cobbled streets, traditional shops and cafes which serve the most delicious cake, cream teas and coffee you will find. The main village in Portland is Easton which sits on the plateau. Then there is Fortuneswell, which lies on a steep hill. Thomas Hardy wrote of Fortuneswell ‘houses above houses, one man’s doorstep rising behind his neighbour’s chimney’ and this is such a perfect way to describe this lovely village.</p><p>The geological location of Portland is such that it attracts rare and wonderful birds and wildlife, so take a ramble along the many networks of footpaths and see what you can spot!</p><h3>Weymouth and Portland during the seasons</h3><p><strong><em>Weymouth and Portland in the spring</em></strong></p><p>The Dorset countryside is resplendent in spring. It’s perfectly gorgeous all year round, but after the cold dark wintry days, when the sun peeps out and the flowers spring, it truly is a sight to behold.</p><p>Enjoy al fresco lunch or dinner on the warmer spring days in Weymouth’s Hope Square and make the most of the lovely restaurants and pubs. Or head harbour side and sip wine whilst you watch the yachts and fishing boats come and go.</p><p>Take a walk on the South West Coastal path around Portland and glimpse the wildlife, which heads here in the springtime. Spring is one of the most exciting times of the year on Portland in terms of the varieties of birds that you will spot, with April at Portland Bill being the time to witness the fascinating scenes of seabird migration.</p><p><strong><em>Weymouth and Portland in the summer</em></strong></p><p>Staying in a seaside holiday cottage during the summer months provides ample opportunities to keep the children entertained. Sandcastles, paddling and picnics can be followed by al fresco dinners right next to the sea.</p><p>Waking up to fresh sea air is so invigorating and can really help to press the pause button on stressful, busy lives. There is also nothing like fresh sea air to help the little ones go to bed nicely exhausted at night! This leaves parents to spend their evenings sipping wine, watching movies, or sitting on the terrace or private garden of one of our beautiful self-catering cottages.</p><p>For a traditional seaside holiday, there is no other place like Weymouth. The lure of Weymouth’s wide bay, sandy beach and elegant esplanade has been tempting holidaymakers for around 250 years and we love having our Dream Cottages office right here in the heart of it. The beach itself has won numerous awards and even just last month, it was awarded ‘No. 1 Beach in the UK’ by TripAdvisor users. It has even been awarded ‘9<sup>th</sup> best beach in Europe’!</p><p><strong><em>Weymouth and Portland in the autumn</em> </strong></p><p>An autumn break by the seaside in a cosy cottage is just what we all need, moving towards the end of our year. Autumn is when we want to cosy up, take bracing walks, kick through the autumn leaves and then retire to a cottage with an open fire or wood burning stove, with a warm cup of hot chocolate.</p><p>If walking is something that you are keen to do in the autumn months, The Weymouth and Portland Legacy Trail is the most wonderful things to do and one of the best ways to explore Dorset. The whole trail is 20km long, from Littlemoor through to Portland Bill or you can visit the main sites by bicycle, bus or car. The walk takes in all the places on the ‘Wild about Weymouth and Portland’ postcards and there are ten circular walks from each spot. The postcards each feature the wildlife that can be seen from each place, from Barn Owls at Lorton Meadows, Little Tern Birds at Chesil Beach, Kestrels at the Merchants Incline, Starling on the Esplanade and Razorbill on the Portland Bill. Simply take your pick from this fantastic wildlife selection and head to these beautiful Weymouth and Portland areas for your fill of enriching wildlife.</p><p><strong><em>Christmas and New Year in Weymouth and Portland</em></strong></p><p>If you are staying in a Dream Cottage in Weymouth or Portland over the festive period and are looking for New Year’s Eve entertainment, just head to Weymouth town centre! Weymouth embrace the countdown to the new year like nowhere else! The town becomes one huge party with everyone wearing fancy dress, live music in the town and in many of the pubs and a loud rendition of Ault Land Syne around the clock. For more glamorous events, many of Weymouth’s hotels hold beautiful New Year’s Eve dinners, such as the Rembrandt with their champagne filled 5 course meal followed by their own live music.</p><p>Christmas in Weymouth is also not to be missed. Twinkling with lights, there are plenty of Christmas events to get you in the spirit. Markets and local boutiques are a fantastic port of call for finding those one of-a-kind gifts!</p><p>Another fine Weymouth tradition happens during the Christmas period every year, normally about a week before Christmas, when hundreds of Santa’s chase a Christmas pudding down Weymouth beach. A lovely 5k run to either join or watch from the sides with a nice warming mulled wine!</p><h3>Things to do in Weymouth and Portland</h3><h2>Beaches</h2><p><strong><em>Weymouth Beach</em></strong></p><p>A blue flag awarded, golden, sandy beach, recently given the ‘No. 1 Beach in the UK’ award by TripAdvisor users. The waters are safe and shallow, which makes it perfect for paddling and swimming. Weymouth beach offers good old fashioned bucket and spade entertainment, with Punch and Judy shows and donkey rides on offer during the summer months. There are also some fabulous summer firework displays. Three miles of sand just next to the lovely seaside town and old harbour. Dogs aren’t allowed on certain areas of the beach between the 1<sup>st</sup> May and 30<sup>th</sup> September but from October 1<sup>st</sup>, walk to your dog’s delight!</p><p><em><strong>Chesil Cove</strong></em></p><p>Chesil Cove is part of Chesil Beach, a large naturally formed pebble bank, 15 miles long. The cove is a great spot for sea fishing and scuba diving. There are a few restrictions for dogs on Chesil Cove, but plenty of spots where dogs are welcome.</p><h2>Castles and Forts</h2><p><em><strong>Portland Castle</strong></em></p><h3>Activities</h3><h2>Walks</h2><p><em><strong>Walk the South West Coastal Path around the Isle of Portland</strong></em></p><p>There is actually a walk right around the Isle of Portland, called ‘The Isle of Portland Circuit’ which follows the South West Coastal Path right around the island. This is 13 miles long, but you needn’t do all of it. Take the dog and follow the dramatic, rugged cliffs, taking in the rare wildlife, hidden coves and stunning views at every turn.</p><p>If you are coming from Weymouth, follow the road and cycle way from Ferry Bridge or Chesil Beach, to join the South West Coastal Path as it climbs to the top of the cliff and then away you go!</p><h2>Bird Watching</h2><p><em>Rare Bird Watching at The Portland Bill</em></p><p>Portland is a major migrating point for birds and bird watching enthusiasts have always flocked here, to glance at some rare specimens. There is even a Portland Bill Observatory running from the Lower Old Lighthouse, open from March to November, where everyone is welcome to join and relax, to wait for some glorious glimpses.</p><p>The area of Southwell is a happy hunting ground for the local Barn Owls, and it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Little Egrets, Grey Herons, Red-throated Divers and Kingfishers around Portland, to name a few!</p><h2>Sailing</h2><p><em><strong>Portland and Weymouth Sailing</strong></em></p><p>Well known for the fantastic sailing conditions, owing to the sheltered location, Portland Harbour and Weymouth were a natural choice to host the Sailing Events in the Olympic Games in 2012. In fact, Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour are reputed to offer some of the best sailing waters on the planet!</p><p>Why not try your hand at sailing around Portland? Try a ‘Taster Session’ to begin with by taking a course with Pet Friendly Weymouth and Portland</h3><h2>Pet Friendly Beaches</h2><p>Weymouth and Portland are absolutely perfect for holidays with your pet. With miles of stunning coastal walks along the heritage status Jurassic coast, pet friendly beaches, welcoming village pubs with beer gardens and country walks right on your doorstep, your four legged friends will enjoy their holiday just as much as you!</p><p>Dogs are welcome all year around to Church Ope Cove in Portland and Bowleaze Cove in Weymouth. They are welcome for some parts of the year on Chesil Cove, Weymouth Beach, Castle Cove, Sandsfoot Castle, Greenhill, Preston and Overcombe. The restrictions are generally held between the 1<sup>st</sup> May and the 30<sup>th</sup> September each year.</p><h2>Pet Friendly Pubs and Restaurants</h2><p>Many pubs and restaurants in Weymouth and Portland lovingly welcome the four legged furry members of your family. After long dog walks, what could be better than to let them curl up beside a cosy open fire which many of our Dorset pubs proudly boast. Here are just some of our favourite pet friendly pubs and restaurants in Weymouth and Portland.</p><p><em><strong>Nothe Fort Café, Weymouth</strong></em></p><p>Nothe Fort is a fantastic dog welcoming attraction in Weymouth.

It is known to have been the home of the leader of the most notorious gang of smugglers in the area during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. It is a beautiful pub with stunning views and sits amongst some of the best dog walks around.

The pub is also just a 20 minute walk east to Ringstead Bay, where the sea is so calm and beautiful that it makes it the perfect place to launch your canoe or kayak.</p><p>Use your Osmington cottage as a base and explore the Jurassic coast. There are some fantastic fossil walks, whether organised by a company or adventured solo. The 195 million year old history stamped into the Jurassic Coast is what makes this area so wonderful. Dorset was tropical and in the centre of the giant Pangaea continent back then so any fossils found today from this time, have not been touched by a living thing for 195 million years, which is pretty incredible and the ease at which you will find complete ammonite fossils in this area makes for an extremely rewarding day.</p><p><strong>Osmington Mills</strong></p><p>The small but perfectly formed village of Osmington Mills is nestled in a small cove on the edge of the coast.

Osmington Mills is home to The Smugglers Inn pub mentioned above. It is super dog friendly with a delicious menu and some great tales of the infamous smugglers who would have drunk tankards of ale there many moons ago. If you are staying in one of our Dream Cottages anywhere near Osmington Mills, then this pub should definitely form a resting point during one of your rejuvenating walks.</p><p><strong>Osmington Mills Beach</strong></p><p>Osmington Mills Beach is a hidden piece of paradise, favoured by the locals, as well as those who may not want the full Punch n Judy Show action found on Weymouth Beach, down the road. The beach is a mix of large rocks and pebbles, with patches of sand and rock pools in between. Perfect for picnics since the flat rocks can hold your glasses of wine just perfectly and crabbing in the rock pools will keep the youngsters entertained for hours. It’s a great beach for swimming too although footwear is advised, to make it more pleasurable.</p><p>Have a browse though some of our prettiest cottages and find one that suits you.

It is thanks to this famous visitor that the famous Osmington White Horse was sculpted into the limestone of Osmington Hill in 1808, celebrating King George III’s visits to this super seaside town.

When Lord Milton bought his estate, Milton Abbey in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the original village of Milton (then Middleton) that lay outside his grand walls just wasn’t attractive enough, so he bought up and demolished all the houses in the space of 15 years and commissioned architect Sir William Chambers to design a new ‘perfect’ village, which is as it stands today. Beautiful thatched village houses that would appear almost like a model village to any passing carriage!</p><p>Our wonderful self-catering holiday cottages in and around Milton Abbas sit beautifully in this particularly special area of Dorset. Set in the heart of rolling green countryside, with a great village pub, The Hambro Arms and the magnificent Milton Abbey which is now possibly the most beautiful school in the entire world, this area of Dorset is straight from an English picture book.</p><p>Further afield, for those wishing to explore the nearby towns, lies the elegant Georgian town of Blandford Forum. Just a 15 minute drive away, Blandford Forum is great for a spot of shopping or dining. With boutique shops, charming little bookshops, stylish galleries and some fantastic regular markets, it’s a lovely town to visit for the day. It has some wonderful tea rooms too, so make sure you stop for a traditional cream tea.</p><p>Dorchester is also just a 25 minute drive away for more boutique shopping, along with some high street names, Michelin starred restaurants and some great museums including the famous <a href=\"https://www.thedinosaurmuseum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dinosaur Museum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teddybearmuseum.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Teddy Bear Museum</a> which the kids will love. <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardys-cottage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hardy’s Cottage</a> is also on the edge of Dorchester, which is also well worth a visit. Dorchester is famous for its regular markets, so try and squeeze one into your holiday itinerary if you can! Pick up some fine Dorset food to take back to your cottage.</p><p>For those wishing to explore the Jurassic Coast, a half an hour drive from your Milton Abbas holiday cottage will take you to the stunning beaches of Weymouth, Lulworth Cove and the beautiful natural landform of Durdle Door.</p><p>Our Milton Abbas holiday cottages also place you in a good spot for some fantastic country walks. Milton Park Wood, Whatcombe Wood, Charity Wood and Crincombe Bottom are all on your doorstep and are perfect for long dog walks and ambles through the woodland.

The archetypal ‘roses round the door’ thatched character cottage is still very popular, but so too are properties with modern clean lines and a contemporary look. Cottages, houses and apartments with a lovely view, either sea or country are keenly sought after. Having a good location near a beach or in a village, with shops and attractions close by are attributes also considered by many as key components. Properties offering single level accommodation or a ground floor bedroom and bathroom, enabling greater access for guests with restricted mobility are increasingly popular - bungalows for example might not be what most people consider to be a ‘dream cottage’ but these are some of our most popular lets; especially ones with a view.</p><p>Guests’ expectations increase year on year; now holiday properties should match if not exceed what guests have at home. Providing bed linen, towels and conveniences like Wi-Fi internet access is increasingly being seen as a pre-requisite when booking.</p><p>Ultimately having ‘curb appeal’ is important; following on from the external appearance of the property and after looking internally, is it somewhere you and the people you know would like to stay for a holiday?</p><p>We continue to keep abreast of an ever changing holiday marketplace, assessing and reviewing whatever our guests feel is key to providing their ‘dream cottage’. We couple this with working closely with and supporting our owners to meet guest expectations.</p><p><strong>Our Services to you</strong></p><p>Our service is tailored to our owners’ needs and ranges from offering a marketing and booking agency service, through to fully managing each booking. This includes organising cleaning, laundry and dealing with any problems or issues guests may have regarding the property, before, during and after their stay.</p><p>Let us know how you would like us to work with you as we can nearly always tailor our service to your needs.</p><p>We are also here to help before you purchase a property. Knowing the business of ‘holiday lettings’ as well as we do, Dream Cottages can provide free advice regarding the suitability of a property to purchase within a specific price range as well as what you could do to optimise bookings. Whilst you are searching for the perfect holiday cottage we are happy to advise on possible rental yields based on individual properties.</p><p>Prior to commencement of lettings, we will give advice and if required assistance with:</p><ul><li>Furnishing, fixtures and fittings to help achieve a wow factor and make your property look as attractive as possible to potential guests as well as keep wear and tear down to a minimum.</li><li>Room configurations including how many and what arrangement of bedrooms and ensuites or the best use of additional living space; an extra den, bedroom or playroom?</li><li>Structural improvements and additional building work.</li><li>Building trade contacts and specialist companies relating to insurance, taxation and health and safety requirements.</li></ul><p><strong> Additional Service Options</strong></p><ul><li>We are flexible in our service approach and so are happy to work with owners who would like to take their own bookings; whilst we are not able to work with other agencies we understand that some owners would like the opportunity to generate their own bookings along with ours.</li><li>A number of our owners live abroad and have little contact with their property; we are happy to be as involved as you would like us to be in terms of managing your property whilst guests are in residence and when the property is vacant via a Property Guardian Service. For an additional fee we can check your property on a regular basis according to your requirements (some insurance policies insist properties are checked periodically) and produce a periodic inspection report if needed.</li><li>Health and Safety compliance - if you would like us to arrange some areas of your compliance (including gas safety and fire risk assessment) we can do this for a fixed fee.</li><li>Trades Contacts - finding a reliable and reasonably priced tradesperson can be difficult. We are happy to provide you with a list comprising contacts from areas as diverse as plumbers, insurance brokers and compliance specialists. Our contacts list has been made up by recommendations from owners over the last 20 years. Whilst we cannot guarantee any of these contacts, we do find word of mouth suggestions the most reliable. You can use these contacts to arrange your own work or we can take care of this and oversee it for you for a fixed percentage charge on the value of the work done.</li><li>Helping arrange your annual VisitEngland rating is part of our service regardless of the level service you have chosen.</li><li>We are very much hands-on experts in the field of holiday letting; do chat to us about any holiday cottage rental related issue you have – we would be happy to help.</li></ul><p><strong>Our Levels of Service</strong></p><p>As with most agencies, ours is primarily a commission based fee so it is in our interests as much as yours to maximise the number of bookings you receive from us.

Dream Cottages is different because it is large enough to have the resources needed to get results yet small enough to still give a personal service.</p><p>Our service begins the moment we start chatting to you about the possibility of taking on your property and does not finish until our guests arrive home from their holiday, even then we contact them to ask for feedback on their holiday in terms of our service and your property.</p><p>Our guests can book online easily or chat to our knowledgeable and friendly booking advisors. This is unlike guests who book with a web based agency who may make contact via a call centre with personnel only able to repeat whatever information is on the computer in front of them. Our staff will know all about our properties including local visitor attractions and recommended pubs and restaurants because they more than likely will have been there themselves.</p><p>We have learned from experience that the tried and tested model of appointing a housekeeper to a specific property is becoming harder and harder to facilitate as good housekeepers / cleaners are difficult to find. Dream Cottages is one of the few agencies that can give owners peace of mind as we have our own affiliated housekeeping company so that you do not have to be concerned should a problem arise at any time. Problems such as what happens when your cleaner is sick, or decides they cannot clean for a particular week or if they don’t do a good enough job or there is a dispute of some sort? We will help take care of any of these issues should they arise. If you also engage the services of our property managers, one of our team will be personally allocated to your property and they will make it their business to know your property inside out. That way maintenance issues are dealt with how you want them to be so you do not have to pay a visit or worry about what is going on.</p><p>We have tried to look at every aspect of the holiday letting process and streamline the process both for owners and guests, offering the best owner and guest experience possible. We are continuously looking to improve what we do and one of the best ways of doing this is by listening carefully to what our owners and guests say and refining our business accordingly.</p><p>Rather than list carefully chosen quotations here, if you would like to speak to one or more of our owners we would be delighted to arrange a call in this regard for you.</p><p><strong>What to do next? </strong></p><p>We would love to hear from you; do ring us on 01305 789000 or email us at admin@dream-cottages.co.uk.</p>')");

The archetypal ‘roses round the door’ thatched character cottage is still very popular, but so too are properties with modern clean lines and a contemporary look. Cottages, houses and apartments with a lovely view, either sea or country are keenly sought after. Having a good location near a beach or in a village, with shops and attractions close by are attributes also considered by many as key components. Properties offering single level accommodation or a ground floor bedroom and bathroom, enabling greater access for guests with restricted mobility are increasingly popular - bungalows for example might not be what most people consider to be a ‘dream cottage’ but these are some of our most popular lets; especially ones with a view.</p><p>Guests’ expectations increase year on year; now holiday properties should match if not exceed what guests have at home. Providing bed linen, towels and conveniences like Wi-Fi internet access is increasingly being seen as a pre-requisite when booking.</p><p>Ultimately having ‘curb appeal’ is important; following on from the external appearance of the property and after looking internally, is it somewhere you and the people you know would like to stay for a holiday?</p><p>We continue to keep abreast of an ever changing holiday marketplace, assessing and reviewing whatever our guests feel is key to providing their ‘dream cottage’. We couple this with working closely with and supporting our owners to meet guest expectations.</p><p><strong>Our Services to you</strong></p><p>Our service is tailored to our owners’ needs and ranges from offering a marketing and booking agency service, through to fully managing each booking. This includes organising cleaning, laundry and dealing with any problems or issues guests may have regarding the property, before, during and after their stay.</p><p>Let us know how you would like us to work with you as we can nearly always tailor our service to your needs.</p><p>We are also here to help before you purchase a property. Knowing the business of ‘holiday lettings’ as well as we do, Dream Cottages can provide free advice regarding the suitability of a property to purchase within a specific price range as well as what you could do to optimise bookings. Whilst you are searching for the perfect holiday cottage we are happy to advise on possible rental yields based on individual properties.</p><p>Prior to commencement of lettings, we will give advice and if required assistance with:</p><ul><li>Furnishing, fixtures and fittings to help achieve a wow factor and make your property look as attractive as possible to potential guests as well as keep wear and tear down to a minimum.</li><li>Room configurations including how many and what arrangement of bedrooms and ensuites or the best use of additional living space; an extra den, bedroom or playroom?</li><li>Structural improvements and additional building work.</li><li>Building trade contacts and specialist companies relating to insurance, taxation and health and safety requirements.</li></ul><p><strong> Additional Service Options</strong></p><ul><li>We are flexible in our service approach and so are happy to work with owners who would like to take their own bookings; whilst we are not able to work with other agencies we understand that some owners would like the opportunity to generate their own bookings along with ours.</li><li>A number of our owners live abroad and have little contact with their property; we are happy to be as involved as you would like us to be in terms of managing your property whilst guests are in residence and when the property is vacant via a Property Guardian Service. For an additional fee we can check your property on a regular basis according to your requirements (some insurance policies insist properties are checked periodically) and produce a periodic inspection report if needed.</li><li>Health and Safety compliance - if you would like us to arrange some areas of your compliance (including gas safety and fire risk assessment) we can do this for a fixed fee.</li><li>Trades Contacts - finding a reliable and reasonably priced tradesperson can be difficult. We are happy to provide you with a list comprising contacts from areas as diverse as plumbers, insurance brokers and compliance specialists. Our contacts list has been made up by recommendations from owners over the last 20 years. Whilst we cannot guarantee any of these contacts, we do find word of mouth suggestions the most reliable. You can use these contacts to arrange your own work or we can take care of this and oversee it for you for a fixed percentage charge on the value of the work done.</li><li>Helping arrange your annual VisitEngland rating is part of our service regardless of the level service you have chosen.</li><li>We are very much hands-on experts in the field of holiday letting; do chat to us about any holiday cottage rental related issue you have – we would be happy to help.</li></ul><p><strong>Our Levels of Service</strong></p><p>As with most agencies, ours is primarily a commission based fee so it is in our interests as much as yours to maximise the number of bookings you receive from us. Our commission rates range from 18% - 24% plus vat and are dependent on the level of service you require plus the profile of your property and if you have more than one property to let.

Some properties have panoramic sea views, while others look out to never ending rolling green hills; the perfect backdrop for time spent with great friends and loved ones.</p><p>For those wishing to take a break from cooking, why not hire a <a href=\"/perfect-ingredients-luxury-getaway-beautiful-dorset-cottage/\">caterer</a>? Even if it’s just for sociable champagne and canapes before you head out for the evening, having a caterer swing by with the finest Dorset delicacies is a great way to get into the relaxing holiday spirit.</p><p>For those wishing to have some fun outside the cottage, there are some fantastic activities to get involved with in Dorset. Whether you want to go for long rambling walks in the country or along the South West Coastal Path stopping off at old thatched pubs along the way, or perhaps enjoy the turquoise seas by kayaking, paddle boarding, or bundling everybody together for a fishing trip on one of the boats from <a href=\"http://www.weymouthboattrips.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Weymouth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bigbuoycharters.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Portland</a>, or <a href=\"https://westbayfishingtrips.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">West Bay</a> harbour.</p><p>Dorset has some fantastic festivals and <a href=\"/dorset-carnival-calendar-2017/\">carnivals</a> in its packed seasonal calendar. The <a href=\"/thrilled-sponsoring-wessex-folk-festival/\">Wessex Folk Festival</a> in Weymouth is a must if you are staying with a large group in June. Every year the streets fill with Morris dancers, live music, cold beer and sunshine. There are two stages; one harbourside in Weymouth and the other on Hope Square right outside our office. The pubs all get involved too with live music and workshops and there is general merriment all around! Definitely not to be missed.</p><p>For families, the draw of Dorset’s award winning beaches is perfect enough. Picnicking, fossil hunting, swimming and sandcastle building will keep the children entertained for hours, all to the backdrop of the beautiful wonders of Dorset, Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove.</p><p>Dorset attracts many large groups of visitors every year. Have a browse through our range of large self-catering properties and find a special one for you and your group.</p>')");

The paths lead through many different gardens including a Rose Garden, a Victorian Garden, a Himalayan Grove, two beautiful lily ponds and a Burmese Rope Bridge crossing a pretty stream. Once you have walked through the gardens, you can enjoy a bite to eat in The Colonial Restaurant before heading back to your cottage to relax in the cottage garden, or by the open fire, weather depending.</p><p>Abbotsbury is the perfect choice for a rural countryside retreat with many added bonuses of the galleries, the beach, the fleet and the wonderful Abbotsbury attractions.

This little village has it all, a lovely rural setting amongst green rolling hills but just steps away from the beach.</p><p>An amble through the village will take you past rows of old stone cottages, dating back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century, beautiful thatched chocolate box dwellings, and a lovely family friendly pub with excellent food and real ales where the locals often get together to play skittles of an evening. Pop and have a cup of tea and a slice of Dorset apple cake in one of the village’s tearooms and then stroll down to the beach.</p><p>If you fancy picking up some Dorset Longhorn beef to cook when you get back to your holiday cottage, head to the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.dorsetlonghorn.co.uk/\">Bride Valley Farm Shop</a> on Market Street and peruse their superb selection of top quality meats, eggs, cheese and chutney.</p><p>Abbotsbury is most well-known for the Abbotsbury Swannery, Abbotsbury Sub-Tropical Gardens and Abbotsbury Children’s Farm. <a href=\"http://abbotsbury-tourism.co.uk/swannery/\">Abbotsbury Swannery</a> is said by the manager to be a ‘five star hotel for swans’ where ‘they’re not penned in. They really want to stay’.
